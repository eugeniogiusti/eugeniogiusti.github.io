    <p>
      After years of building software for other people, managing client projects, handling invoices, tracking payments and juggling multiple tools, I realized something simple:
    </p>
    <p><strong>I did not have a workspace that truly fit the way I work.</strong></p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="mb-5">
  <h3>There Was Always Something Missing</h3>
  <p>
    I tried using different tools.
    Task managers.
    Note apps.
    Billing platforms.
    Spreadsheets.
  </p>
  <p>
    But everything was fragmented.
    Tasks in one place.
    Costs in another.
    Payments somewhere else.
    Invoice drafts disconnected from actual project data.
  </p>
  <p>
    As a developer, that friction adds up.
    Context switching kills clarity.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="mb-5">
  <h3>So I Built What I Needed</h3>
  <p>
    Instead of adapting my workflow to a SaaS product,
    I decided to build a workspace around the way I actually operate.
  </p>
  <p>
    That’s how IndieDesk started.
  </p>
  <p>
    A clean, focused Laravel application where:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Each project is a central container.</li>
    <li>Tasks live inside the project.</li>
    <li>Costs are tied directly to that project.</li>
    <li>Payments are tracked against real work.</li>
    <li>Invoice drafts are generated from actual project data.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="mb-5">
  <h3>Why Self-Hosted?</h3>
  <p>
    I didn’t want another subscription.
    I didn’t want vendor lock-in.
    I didn’t want to depend on someone else’s roadmap.
  </p>
  <p>
    IndieDesk is self-hosted by design.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>You deploy it on your own server.</li>
    <li>You own the code.</li>
    <li>You can modify everything.</li>
    <li>You are not forced into predefined billing systems.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    It’s a foundation, not a cage.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="mb-5">
  <h3>Built With Real-World Usage in Mind</h3>
  <p>
    IndieDesk is not a theoretical side project.
    It was shaped by actual freelance work.
  </p>
  <p>
    When you manage multiple clients,
    you need visibility.
  </p>
  <p>
    How much has been paid?
    What’s still outstanding?
    Which project is consuming more time?
    Are costs eating into margins?
  </p>
  <p>
    IndieDesk gives that operational clarity.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="mb-5">
  <h3>The Technical Foundation</h3>
  <p>
    The application is built with Laravel 12, using Blade components and a clean relational structure.
  </p>
  <p>
    The architecture is intentionally simple:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Clients</li>
    <li>Projects</li>
    <li>Tasks</li>
    <li>Costs</li>
    <li>Payments</li>
    <li>Invoice Drafts</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    No over-engineering.
    Just structured entities that reflect real work.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="mb-5">
  <h3>From Personal Tool to Public Template</h3>
  <p>
    At some point, I realized this wasn’t just useful for me.
  </p>
  <p>
    Many developers face the same operational chaos.
    Especially indie hackers and freelancers who want control without complexity.
  </p>
  <p>
    So I decided to release IndieDesk as a template.
  </p>
  <p>
    Not as a bloated SaaS.
    Not as a locked ecosystem.
    But as a starting point anyone can modify and extend.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="mb-5">
  <h3>Who It’s For</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Developers managing client projects.</li>
    <li>Freelancers who want cost and payment clarity.</li>
    <li>Indie hackers building their own internal tools.</li>
    <li>Anyone who prefers owning their stack.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="mb-5">
  <h3>Final Thought</h3>
  <p>
    IndieDesk is not about hype.
    It’s about control.
  </p>
  <p>
    It’s about building your own operational backbone instead of renting one.
  </p>
  <p>
    I built it because I needed it.
    I released it because others might need it too.
  </p>
